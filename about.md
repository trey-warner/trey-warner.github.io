![Me](https://github.com/trey-warner/trey-warner.github.io/blob/master/images/me.png?raw=true)  
I am Trey the great the very great! Why do you need to know about me? That's all I am. **JK**! I am Trey and this is my very first jekyll website (blog). I only use jekyll for github pages though. I am a fan of old movies and songs (especially the Venture) and I like using vim and nano when I edit code.

Movies/Shorts I Like
--------------------
* For a Few Dollars More
* The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly
* Modern Times
* The Great Dictator
* Charles Chaplin's shorts
